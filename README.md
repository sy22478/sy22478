**Project Overview**

**ReneWind - Wind Turbine Predictive Maintenance System**
- Analyzed massive-scale sensor data (40+ features, and 20,000 training samples) to build a predictive maintenance pipeline that enables 70-85% maintenance cost reduction through proactive failure detection and scheduling optimization.
- Engineered ensemble of 7 deep learning models using TensorFlow/Keras with advanced class imbalance handling techniques (17:1 failure ratio), achieving optimal recall to minimize costly undetected turbine failures.
- Translated complex model outputs into actionable business insights for the Department of Energy stakeholders, delivering executive-ready cost-benefit analysis with clear ROI projections and operational recommendations.


**Restaurant Turnover Prediction - Hackathon Champion**
- Won competitive data science hackathon by developing a sophisticated weighted ensemble model combining LightBGM, XGBoost, and CatBoost with Optuna hyperparameter optimization, achieving industry-leading 12.2M RMSE performance.
- Created comprehensive feature engineering pipeline processing 34+ engineered features to uncover hidden patterns in restaurant turnover data, enabling predictive insights for workforce planning.
- Delivered data-driven retention strategies through customer-backward analysis, providing restaurant operators with actionable insights to reduce employee turnover costs and improve operational stability.


**EasyVisa - Immigration Data Analytics Platform**
- Engineered predictive analytics pipeline processing historical immigration datasets to forecast visa approval probabilities and processing timeline optimization for legal case management.
- Built interactive stakeholder dashboard enabling legal professionals to analyze approval trends, identify successful case patterns, and optimize preparation strategies using data-driven insights.
- Delivered customer-backwards analytical framework that helps immigration attorneys maximize client success rates through historical pattern recognition and case outcome prediction modeling

**Personal Loan Campaign Optimization - Banking Analytics**
- Built advanced customer segmentation model achieving 84.56% recall and 92.65% precision on severely imbalanced dataset (9.6% positive class), enabling precise identification of loan-eligible customers for AllLife Bank.
- Developed interpretable decision tree rules through post-pruning optimization, creating clear business logic that marketing teams can implement: "Income > $92.5K + Family <u><</u> -> Very High likelihood".
- Generated customer-backwards segmentation strategies that maximize campaign ROI by identifying high-value customer segments while minimizing outreach costs and false positive targeting.

**FoodHub: Enhancing Restaurant Experience with Data Science**
- Analyzed 1,898 food delivery orders to uncover customer preferences, restaurant performance trends, and operational inefficiencies for data-driven business decisions.
- Identified popular cuisines, peak ordering times, high-performing restaurants, and revenue drivers using exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Conducted multivariate analysis using Pandas, visualized patterns in cuisine popularity and order timing with Seaborn/Matplotlib, and derived actionable metrics like platform revenue and restaurant eligibility for promotions.
- Revealed key insights including weekend surge in orders, top performing cuisines (Indian & Italian), and opportunities to streamline preparation time for high-demand but slow cuisines.

**Resume tailor: AI agent to tailor resume based on job description**
- Engineered a resume tailoring AI agent using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), leveraging OpenAIÊ¼s Assistant API, Cursor, and LangChain.
- Implemented document retrieval from user-uploaded resumes and generated customized versions aligned with specific job descriptions.
- Built a web UI with Streamlit to enable seamless interaction between users and the AI agent.

**HealthMate: Agentic Healthcare Assistant**
- Designed and deployed an agentic AI health assistant using OpenAI's Agent SDK and LangChain to integrate function calling, intelligent routing, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Pinecone, enabling autonomous, context-aware medical interactions and decision support.
- Developed and trained machine learning models for cardiovascular risk, diabetes prediction, and mental health screening using real-world data; applied feature engineering and time-series analysis to improve predictive accuracy and reduce false positives.
- Engineered a production-grade AI system using microservices architecture (8 services) with FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Kubernetes.
- Implemented JWT-based authentication, RBAC, audit logging, and field-level AES-256 encryption to ensure HIPAA and GDPR compliance.
- Built a full-stack data pipeline and interactive dashboard with Streamlit and WebSocket integration, enabling real-time health data visualization, trend analysis, and user management metrics through ETL pipelines and multi-source data aggregation (e.g., Fitbit, Apple Health)
